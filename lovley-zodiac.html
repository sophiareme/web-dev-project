      <h2> Really Quick...What are "Zodiacs?"</h2>
      <h4> To put it simply, in astrology, zodiacs are directly related to the twelve specific constellations of the zodiac that the sun passes through (listed above). What makes these specific bunches of stars so popular, is the belief that it connects to ones personality and overall influence of someones life, as a zodiac is determined by your birthday. These special twelve were created by the Babylonians in 1894 BC. The belief of atrolgy spread all over, but our modern way of using it comes from the Greeks, who adopted the study along the line and incorperated it to connect with a person.   </h4>

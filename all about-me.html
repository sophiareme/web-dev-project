    <p1> My name is Sophia Reme. In the fall, I will be an incoming senior at Niles North Highschool. At school, I try to be as involved as I can. Freshman year I took part in B.S.U, D.R.E.A.M, And stage crew. This past year, I joined DECA and coding club, as I found out that I had an interest in both business and computer science. Outside of school, I love to read, write, bake and cook, listen to music, and hang out with friends and family. What got me into coding was my love for electronics that started as early has my elemenetary school days. I was super obssessed with Youtube and Episode. I loved editing videos and writing stories. In middle school, I got into video editing with effects,transitions, all of that jazz, but I didnt know that there were specific field of this until freshman year. With covid affecting my highschool years, there wasnt much I could do, but I still tried everything to get more involved before college. (ex. joined coding club and watched tutorials on yt) I have been very into comp sci and everything with programming and development </p1>
